  **spoiler alert** My favorite part of this book was the setting (basically Iceland in my opinion). The setting was the most consistent facet of the story, as it moved through seven stages of history going backwards from 2070 to time unknown. The island was beautiful and harsh, a reflection of the theme of sacrifice that goes throughout the story. It was a little hard to follow what was happening, even with the names staying the same. I think it should be an adult book because of that as well as the ages of the characters in most sections and the heavy topics that are dealt with. I loved the way it read almost like a saga, a folk legend, with so much suggestion in the short segments of the story.

  **spoiler alert** Princess Diaries is a charming book in which Cabot displays her remarkable ability to write just like a teenage girl thinks. Mia, like any other fourteen-year-old girl, is plagued with insecurities. But she still comes out strong, telling off her dad, her grandmother, and the guy who asks her out just to get his face on a magazine cover. Though ostensibly the story is focused on Mia finding out she’s princess of Genovia, the heart of the story was in her relationships—her relationship with her somewhat irresponsible mother, her math teacher/her mom’s boyfriend, her best friend Lily (with whom she has a major argument that is one of the central issues of the book), and a new friend Tina. Cabot also contrasts Mia’s starry-eyed crush on the ever-so-attractive Josh to her genuine friendship with Lily’s older brother Michael, subtly directing teens to look for relationships with people they can talk to and who are nice instead of people who are just good looking. 	Cabot also does a good job writing Mia as a girl who worries about normal things. Suddenly becoming a princess doesn’t overshadow her concerns about her looks, her math grades, or her friends. 	This book would be appealing to teens because Mia is a relatable, real character who has something pretty amazing happen to her. But the interesting part is she’s not excited to be a princess, instead focusing on all the reasons why it’s going to be hard. Instead, Cabot has Mia focus on things that any teenage girl could achieve—good friendships and good relationships. There are also a number of political agendas mentioned, such as animal rights, democracy, and racism, but they’re dealt with in a way that feels natural rather than didactic. Lily’s reaction to the supposed racism at the deli next to the school gives some perspective to the girls’ political ideas. I'd say this is a good book for teens ages 12 to 17

  **spoiler alert** ""Skellig"" is a book that seemed targeted to a younger audience, maybe 8-13. It followed Michael as he moved into a new house with a dilapidated garage. His mother delivers a baby girl whose health is precarious, and much of the drama of the book is focused on whether the baby will live. Michael finds a man in the garage that is something like an angel or a bird or a mythical creature, a dirty Chinese food loving sort of angel. Michael and his new friend Mina help this creature, whose name is Skellig, regain health and strength until he flies away, but not before he visits Michael's baby sister. The book discusses education and friendship and family and was sweetly told and well written.

  **spoiler alert** ""Prom"" follows Ashley Hannigan through the last weeks of her senior year. Ostensibly the story is about a non-prom-er's conversion to the night of magic and how she saves prom almost single-handedly. But the real heart of the story, and what I think Anderson intended to be the heart of the story, was the relationships. Ashley's family is messy and loud and unsophisticated from their first introduction, but there's never a question that they all love each other. Her neighbor and best friend Nat LOVES prom and helping her is Ash's reason for becoming involved in prom. My favorite character in the book was Nat's бабушка, her Russian grandma. She was feisty and half-mad and served as Ash's fairy godmother figure. Ash has a boyfriend throughout the book who seems more interested in her body at his convenience than anything else, and at prom she finally breaks up with him. When her baby sister is born, she decides to go to college, something she'd never planned on. Ash is a relatable character with familiar teenage reactions, and Anderson's writing is engaging and fun. A good book for older teens due to (somewhat overdone, in my opinion) mature content.

  **spoiler alert** ""Hatchet"" is an enjoyable, entertaining book. It was interesting to reread it after 10+ years. Brian is flying to visit his father in Canadian oil fields after his parents' divorce, thinking about the Secret that he knows (which turns out to be that he saw his mother kissing another man before the divorce). The pilot has a heartattack and Brian crash-lands the plane. He survives in the wilderness for two months until the plane is disturbed from its watery grave by a tornado and he finds a distress signal inside a survival kit. The book was written in a semi-stream-of-consciousness style, which added to the urgency of the situation and allowed the reader to feel much more inside Brian's head (though the book is written in third person). This book is maybe better for slightly younger audiences, 10-14, as it is interesting but is so short that it inevitably lacks depth.

  **spoiler alert** So obviously, by the number of stars I gave this book, I didn't like it. But I'll start with what I did like--Hesse did a good job of evoking the era, and the description of the setting was beautiful. Billie Jo was well-characterized and Hesse did a great job of writing in her voice. However. I mean, do we really need to read a book that's not only set in perhaps the most depressing time of American history, but also involves the main character accidentally burning her mother to death? I argue that is excessive. Yes, the Dust Bowl was NOT a happy time and I don't expect to read a happy book set in that time, but REALLY? That just seems like the author is taking too much delight in describing pain and misery, like she was thinking, ""What is the absolute most horrible thing I can imagine for a fourteen-year-old to go through? GOT IT!"" Yeah, you really got it, Hesse. That was awful. And it's not like that's going to teach us about the experience, because I would bet that most people have not accidentally set their mothers on fire and watched them die and ruined their own piano-playing hands in the process, so it's not like teens are going to be thinking, ""Wow, the Dust Bowl was hard, and the time was different, but I can definitely relate to that character."" They're going to be thinking, ""AAAAAHHHHH!! THIS IS AWFUL!"" Or they will if they're anything like me. There are ways to have a character have to go through a hard time without having them accidentally kill one of their parents in a horrible conflagration. I would never recommend this book to anyone because what I came away with was a really awful memory of the description of the fire and her mother's wounds and that's about it. Oh, and of course, Mom was pregnant at the time too, and the baby died too, just in case it wasn't gruesome enough as it was. If I had to choose an age range, I sure wouldn't give this to anyone younger than seventeen because if those images are graphic for me, I can't imagine what they'd do to a little twelve-year-old reading a book about a young girl. Yeah, I understand it garnered awards, and the prose was good, but good prose a good novel maketh not. Writing something awful in beautiful words doesn't make that awful thing beautiful. Sure, Billie Jo heals (somewhat) by the end and her dad remarries, which was nice. But it's hard to even remember or care about that part with the initial violence.

  **spoiler alert** This book was very interesting. The portrayal of Marcelo was sweet and compassionate, the prose of his inner thoughts beautiful and simple. The characters were delightfully complicated, from Arturo to Jasmine's father. It seemed that Marcelo had to learn that good and evil are not as simple as they may seem, but that some of the complications people want to place on good and evil are falsifications. I found some of the ideas a little too preachy, and I thought the portrayal of the real world was a little dark. The book took itself a little too seriously for my taste, hence the three stars, but it was a pretty book. I would recommend this book for 16 and up due to darker dealing with darker themes.

  **spoiler alert** Eric Calhoune and Sarah Byrnes have been friend for a long time as the two freaks--Eric was very overweight and Sarah's face is disfigured with burns. Eric lost some weight and started moving away from Sarah and getting new friends. Sarah one day became catatonic in school and was hospitalized. Eric tries to figure out what happened and learns that the burns weren't the accident she claims they were but that her father intentionally caused them and her mother abandoned her as a result. Sarah finds her mother with help from a teacher, but her mother won't come to testify against Sarah's father. Eric won't tell Sarah's father where she is and he tries to kill Eric but only succeeds in wounding him. Eric and Sarah renew their friendship after her father is killed by Eric's mom's girlfriend. The book deals with physical appearance, religion, and abortion (Eric's girlfriend was forced to have an abortion by the father of her baby who also was outspoken against abortion). The book was okay but seemed a little . . . exaggerated. It was also critical of organized religions that called sin sin because that puts too much pressure on people, which wasn't really a point I agreed with. I don't know that I'd recommend this book to anyone, but it would probably be inappropriate for anyone younger than fifteen or sixteen.

  **spoiler alert** This is the story of 14-year-old LaVaughn and 17-year-old Jolley. Jolley has two children and hires LaVaughn to be her nanny while she works. LaVaughn, who's always wanted to go to college, helps Jolley get back to school and pull her life together. I am not personally a fan of novels in verse, but even for me, this book was pretty good. The verse writing as well as LaVaughn's age kept it from being too dark and depressing, even though the potential was there. Not that Wolff shied away, but she didn't write about problems as unfixable, or broken lives as unfixable. I would say this book is good for ages 13+.

  **spoiler alert** This is an excellent book. Cassie, the protagonist, is a young girl living in Mississippi during the Depression. Her family works their own land, but many of the African-Americans work fields that belong to rich white people. When two men are burned alive in their home, one dying immediately and one later, Cassie's parents initiate a boycott of the store owned by the people responsible for the lynching. TJ, a friend of Cassie's brother, ends up dying after two white friends let him get caught stealing and take the blame for it. I loved the way this book portrayed the racism in the south. I liked how Taylor portrayed that it was complex, and individuals behaved differently from the crowd. I loved Cassie's family, the way her parents tried to protect her from the worst of the racism, the way they were together. I loved Big Mama and Uncle Hammer, their strong personalities and their relationships with Cassie.

  **spoiler alert** ""Hole in my Life"" was not my favorite book. It was an autobiographical account of Gantos during his senior year of high school. He left his family on the Virgin Islands to finish school in Florida. While there, he became very involved in drugs and alcohol. He returned to his family after finishing school and become more involved in drugs during a time of racial tension on the Virgin Islands. When he's offered ten grand to help sail a boat filled with drugs to New York, he agrees. On the boat, he spends the majority of his time high. Once in New York, he helps distribute the drugs, then gets caught along with the others who were working with him. He's imprisoned for around a year before being released. The book was frustrating to me because it seemed like Gantos' felt no guilt for anything he'd done and only counted it all as good because he ended up seriously writing by the end. It didn't cause me to reflect or change my thinking about anything, instead leaving me frustrated and regretful that I'd wasted my time reading it.

  **spoiler alert** Hinton's now-class YA fiction is centered on Ponyboy, a fourteen-year-old ""greaser"" whose family consists of his brothers and a handful of other gang members. The action centers around Johnny, who has been previously attacked and beaten up by the Socs, the rich kids from the other side of the tracks. When the Socs attack Johnny and Ponyboy, Johnny fights back and ends up killing one of the Socs. Johnny and Ponyboy go on the run with help from Dallas, another gang member. When they're set to return, the church they've been hiding in goes up in flames, and the two boys, along with Dallas, go inside to save the children. Johnny's back is broken in the excitement, and he ultimately dies. Dallas is heartbroken and commits suicide. Ponyboy, after all this, learns not to fight so much with his brothers. Hinton mirrored her own life in the book and it comes out in the description of how Ponyboy feels trapped by his label, even though he doesn't actively work to buck the label. The relationship between Ponyboy and his brothers rang true. This would be a good book for middle schoolers and some high schoolers, good for teaching about seeing past labels and focusing on what's most important.

  **spoiler alert** I hated this book. I would never, ever have read it for class, and even then, I regret reading it. People go on and on about Cormier's ""beautiful"" prose--I didn't see it. It was fine, but it sure didn't redeem the plot. Not that it was badly done, and I'm sure Cormier did exactly what he intended to do . . . if he intended to paint a picture of despair, in which those who stand up really shouldn't have done that, and bullies get and keep all the power. Great message, Cormier. I understand that the point is to be ""bleak."" The thing I don't understand is why such a novel would be written. I've been told that it's more realistic and therefore good because sometimes when you stand up against corruption, it doesn't go well. I just didn't even read Jerry's rebellion as standing up for anything--it more seemed that he wanted to ""disturb the universe"" (which I'm sure Cormier was fully aware was from ""The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock"" but it sounds cooler to say ""The Wasteland"" so the boy just assumed it was from ""The Wasteland"") for the sake of disturbing the universe. Not really because he thought the bullies were doing a wrong thing, or that he wanted to stop them. Just . . . to disturb. I understand that I'm supposed to find the ""virtuous, lovely or of good report or praiseworthy"" but I didn't see it. I can't turn off my ""judging"" and just try to see what the author was trying to do and somehow find something positive, because I think that the author's goal was to explore despair and darkness without really coming out the better for it. I would never recommend this to anyone of any age.

  **spoiler alert** Armstrong's nonfiction book follows the genuinely extraordinary tale of Shackleton's Antarctic expedition. She tracks their departure from London, their stops, their time locked in ice, and the final journey from Elephant Island to Stromness. The actions and doings of the men are catalogued in an interesting way, reading more like a novel than just a recounting of historical events. It is a condensed telling of the tale, leaving out many details, as is necessary for the shorter attention span of Armstrong's intended audience. Armstrong's storytelling is excellent, and the details chosen weave a vivid picture of all the dangers Shackleton and his crew faced and how they overcame them. This would be a good book for anyone old enough to understand it, both educational and exciting.

  **spoiler alert** So . . . if you love post modernism, this book is for you. If you love books that leave you thinking ""wha . . ."" then this book is for you. If you like books where basically every character is a jerk (except the English teacher, of course), then this book is for you. ""Monster"" is the story of Steve and his trial for being an accomplice to murder. He is ultimately acquitted but it's pretty up in the air for much of the story. The reader feels something like the jury, trying to decide if Steve is innocent or not, never knowing for sure. Steve's experience in jail while waiting for the trial is less than pleasant, which I imagine is quite accurate. The most interesting part of this book was the exploration of how a person decides to commit a crime, and the idea that it isn't just one day thinking, ""Well, I'm probably going to go rob a convenience store and possibly commit murder today."" It's a series of decisions. The reason I only gave it two stars, however, is because for me it didn't really resonate. Everyone in the book annoyed me, Steve's family annoyed me a lot, his lawyer annoyed me, the way no one in the whole book (again, other than the English teacher) seemed like a good person annoyed me . . . I suppose that was Myers' intention and I don't necessary mean to disparage it, I just didn't personally like it. I can see why it's an award-winning book, though. The way it's told is interesting, too, like a film. Lets the reader see how Steve needs to distance himself from what happened. I don't think readers younger than sixteen or so would get much out of this book because of the disjointed way it's told.

  **spoiler alert** The concept of ""Whirligig"" was interesting--it dealt with repentance and right and wrong and how to overcome past mistakes. However, I found the prose stiff and unrealistic and the author's conclusions about repentance to be unhelpful and impractical. Brent has moved to a new town and gets himself invited to a party, but he wears the wrong clothes (one unrealism: a high school kegger party being ""cool"" in which the person who holds it demands everyone wears black and white and play giant chess) and is humiliated by a girl he had been trying to pursue. In response, he drinks heavily and attempts to commit suicide by letting go of his car's wheel. Instead of dying, he kills another girl. Her mother (in another unlikely move) requests that he builds whirligigs in the four corners of the United States because then people will smile like they smiled when they saw her daughter. He agrees, and a sixteen-year-old treks around the US building whirligigs. His chapters are interposed with the lives of those who are affected by his whirligigs (including teenage girls whose dialogue is not even remotely related to any teenage dialogue I have ever heard). Ultimately, Brent feels that he can meet random strangers, make friends, and then feel comfortable with never, ever seeing them again, but somehow becoming better for the depthless acquaintances. As to anything virtuous, lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy about this book? It is a good example of postmodernism, I suppose. The descriptions are clear and concise. The variety of characters is interesting, and the multiple voices distinct from each other. This book would probably be appropriate for readers age 13 and up.

**spoiler alert** American Born Chinese follows three seemingly unrelated storylines--The Monkey King, who wants to be powerful and respected as a god
  **spoiler alert** American Born Chinese follows three seemingly unrelated storylines--The Monkey King, who wants to be powerful and respected as a god; Jin Wang, a second-generation child of immigrants struggling to fit in at his mostly-white school; and Danny, whose Chinese cousin Chin-Kee shows up every year and humiliates Danny by displaying many American stereotypes of Chinese people. It turns out that the monkey king, whose journey leads him to understand that he is best as a monkey, accepting himself as he is, is the father of one of Jin Wang's friends. Jin Wang in turn is Danny, as Jin was unable to pursue the girl of his dreams because he was Chinese. In the end, Jin is able to accept himself as he is, giving up his ""Danny"" persona and embracing his true identity. I loved this book so much. The graphic novel aspect made it fast-paced, though the reader could slow down and learn a lot more from the images. It allowed a lot to go unsaid but still be part of the story, letting Yang's messages of identity and racism to be clear without being didactic. The interweaving of the stories and the eventual ""aha!"" moment kept interest, as well as letting the reader draw the conclusion without being dragged to it. I would recommend this book for 14-year-olds or older, as the themes are a little complicated for younger children.

  **spoiler alert** In ""Bomb"" Sheinkin follows the development and deployment of the first atomic bombs. His expanse is fairly broad, though he does a good job of narrowing his sweep to focus on a few main characters. He begins with the spy Gold being caught after passing on information to the Soviets for years. He then highlights Oppenheimer, another spy Fuchs, the Norwegian team who destroyed the Germans' source of hard water, and an American spy who chooses to betray his country. Sheinkin is a masterful storyteller, drawing out details to make the story memorable as well as interesting.

  **spoiler alert** ""The Noble Servant"" follows Magdalena as she gets a surprising invitation to marry the Duke of Wolfberg (surprising because though she is the daughter of a baron, her family is very poor). On the way to marry the duke, her servant forces her to trade places, so Magdalena becomes a goose girl at the duke's castle and the servant masquerades as the lady who will marry the duke. The duplicity is deeper than that--the duke is not really the duke, but his cousin, whose scheming father sent assassins to murder the real duke. The real duke evaded the assassins, and is disguised as a shepherd at his own castle. Through a series of troubles, the two recognize each other and prove their respective identities. They also fall in love and marry. As always, Ms. Dickerson delivered a great read with pleasant Christian themes as well as a fun fairytale-inspired story. It's a quick read without too much complicated language and would be good for anyone from twelve and up.

  **spoiler alert** ""The Silent Songbird"" is a loose retelling of Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid."" Evangeline is the king's ward and an illegitimate daughter of the king's uncle. She's lived all her life in seclusion, largely with the companionship of servants. The king arranges for her to marry an old man whose previous wife died in mysterious circumstances. She runs away rather than marry the man, falling into company with a handsome young man she initially assumes is a peasant but later learns is the son of a lord. To avoid discovery, she pretends to be mute and has her maidservant speak for her. Eventually her lie comes out, but that's overcome because she saves a few people's lives on a few difference occasions. She falls in love with the handsome young man and is able to marry him after a plot to kill the king is discovered and stopped by her and the young man. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, which was simple but had a good core, promoting Christian values without detracting or distracting from the story.

  **spoiler alert** ""The Viscount's Proposal"" is a regency romance with subtle nods to ""Pride and Prejudice."" Leorah is a headstrong individual, refusing to bow to social rules she views as inane, instead letting her conscience guide her behavior. Viscount Withinghall is a very upright, uptight gentleman who has determined Leorah is a wild card and wants to stay away from her. A series of unfortunate events leads them to spend a few hours in an overturned carriage together in the dark, which causes a great deal of gossip. The lord's leg is broken, and he convalesces at Leorah's family home. The two develop something of a friendship, but when the lord proposes out of duty, Leorah refuses. They are separated, but eventually come back together and through a few trying moments, come to realize that they do love each other and marry. I loved this book, particularly the character of Leorah. The lessons that both she and the viscount learned seemed realistic and helpful to me. As per usual, Dickerson brought in Christian themes that enhanced the story and gave it more depth.

**spoiler alert** I love this book. Diana Wynne Jones begins by playing off fairytale stereotypes--the oldest child never amounts to much in fairytale
  **spoiler alert** I love this book. Diana Wynne Jones begins by playing off fairytale stereotypes--the oldest child never amounts to much in fairytales, so her heroine is an oldest child. The stepmother is always wicked, so her stepmother is kind, if a bit selfish and thoughtless. The heroes are strong and morally impervious, so her hero is always slithering out of things, until the end when he finally stands and fights, but only by tricking himself into it. Sophie (said heroine) is cursed to become an old lady by a witch who mistakes her for her sister (and a whole mess of mistaken identity surrounds her sisters and another lady that Howl courts). She sets out to find her way, and ends up at Howl's moving castle, where she makes a bargain with the fire demon and becomes a cleaning lady. The plot is so cleverly constructed, hints dropping almost imperceptibly and all wrapping up so fast at the end that as a reader I almost wasn't sure what was happening until I read it through a second time. This story has delightful commentary on stereotypes and what it is to behave well. Sophie is constantly trying to do the right thing but feels like she always ruins everything, though in the end she successfully saves the day with help from Howl. I loved the theme of getting a happy ending that wasn't expected and that the getter wasn't sure she deserved. It's a hopeful theme, that even those who don't expect much of themselves but go out and try anyway can make something of themselves after all.

  **spoiler alert** I LOVE this book. It's wonderful because it has the fairy tale and romantic elements that I loved when I read it when I was a teen but it has so much depth in the conversation about the meaning of life and the nature of death that I loved it even more now rereading it as an adult. At the beginning, Keturah is lost in the forest and Death comes to collect her. He is an aristocratic man, someone Keturah has seen before, more than she knew as she realizes throughout the story. She bargains with him for one more day because she needs to find her true love. She ends up getting four more days, and Death finally says he will let her live until she wishes release because he's fallen in love with her and can't refuse her anything. Meanwhile, Keturah's been checking out everyone in the village to see who she can fall in love with, while matchmaking her friends and trying to save her lord from humiliation and her fellow villagers from the plague. In the end, though, she realizes that she's loved Death all along and goes with him. Something I didn't realize reading this when I was younger was that Leavitt wrote it in part because she had a sister who died young and this was her way of exploring that, of walking with a child dying. It made the book a lot more significant to me to realize that. I would recommend this for twelve and up because the language is accessible and the story is interesting for younger readers, and for older readers, the depth is wonderful.
